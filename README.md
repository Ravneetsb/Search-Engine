A request to all USFCA CS 272 students:
Please do not use this code to complete your assignments. You will most likely be caught for plagiarism and you don't need to go through that.
As difficult as you may find this class, if you put in the effort I promise this will result in a project that you will be proud of.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to talk to Sophie and the TAs. I found their help very useful.
